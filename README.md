### **The Structure of a Microsoft License Key**  
A standard Windows or Office product key consists of **25 characters** in the following format:  
```
XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX
```
Each section contains **five alphanumeric characters**, separated by dashes. This format has remained consistent across different Windows and Office versions.

### **Who Invented This Format?**  
Microsoft introduced product keys in **1995** with Windows 95 to prevent unauthorized installations. Before that, Windows did not require activation, allowing users to install copies freely.  

Bill Gates and the Microsoft licensing team developed the system to limit piracy and ensure compliance with software agreements.

### **Why This Format?**  
The **25-character** structure was chosen for several reasons:  
- **Security:** A longer key reduces the chances of random guessing.  
- **Uniqueness:** It allows Microsoft to generate billions of unique keys.  
- **Ease of Use:** The alphanumeric format is readable and can be manually entered if needed.  

Microsoft later improved the system by introducing online activation, reducing the risk of duplicate activations.

### **Evolution of License Keys**  
- **Windows 95 - XP:** Simple product keys without online verification.  
- **Windows Vista - 7:** Activation required online validation or a KMS server.  
- **Windows 8 - 11:** Keys are embedded in BIOS for OEM devices, reducing manual entry.  

Office followed a similar path, requiring activation since **Office XP** (2001).  

This structured approach to licensing remains a key part of Microsoftâ€™s software security strategy.
